<h2>AudioPlayer</h2>

<p><code>AudioPlayer</code> is an object allowing us to control
music playback, playing sounds over HTTP, HTTPS, RTSP or the file
protocol. To play music (e.g., as background music for a game) we can do
something simple like this:</p>

<pre><code>Widget.Multimedia.AudioPlayer.onStateChange = function(state){
    if (state == 'opened'){
        Widget.Multimedia.AudioPlayer.play();
    }
}

Widget.Multimedia.AudioPlayer.open('http://.../file.mp3');</code></pre>

<p>Apart from opening the audio player and starting playback, you
can also stop and pause/resume playback. These are all very similar
methods. Just remember that these calls are executed asynchronously, so
you need to define <code>onStateChange</code> callbacks to handle state
changes of the player, when the following states occur:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>opened</code> – when an audio file is loaded
	successfully</li>
	<li><code>playing</code> – when playback has started, after
	calling <code>play()</code></li>
	<li><code>stopped</code> – when playback has stopped, after
	calling <code>stop()</code></li>
	<li><code>completed</code> – when playback has stopped after
	reaching the end of a track.</li>
	<li><code>paused</code> – when playback is paused</li>
</ul>
